# Projects



## [Product Review Analysis](https://github.com/stunn-areeb09/Product-Review-Analysis)




#### - Achieved an accuracy of more than 90%.

#### - Implemented Product Review Analysis (Sentiment Analysis) of Reviews from the E-commerce websites ,classifying a Review as Positive ,Negative or Neutral.

#### - Implemented Lexicon (Rule) based Analysis treating every positive and negative sentiment with their respective scores and adding them to obtain the overall sentiment of a   sentence. 

#### - Converted the tokens carrying vectors thereby giving them some valid values using Count vectoriser and applied various Machine Learning algorithms like Linear SVC(SVM) ,       Random Forests and Logistic regression. 

#### - In Deep Learning Approach used CNN Bidirectional LSTM with the sequence model as -  Conv1D -> Conv1D -> Conv1D -> MaxPooling1D -> BidirectionalLSTM -> Dense -> Dropout -> Dense -> Dropout -> Dense -> Dropout -> Output.
